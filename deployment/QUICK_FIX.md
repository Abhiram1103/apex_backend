# 🔧 Quick Fix for Render Python Version Error

## ✅ Fixed Files

I've updated these files to fix the Python 3.13 compatibility issue:

### Created `runtime.txt` files:
- ✅ `deployment/job-recommendation-api/runtime.txt` → `python-3.11.9`
- ✅ `deployment/skill-gap-api/runtime.txt` → `python-3.11.9`
- ✅ `deployment/chatbot-api/runtime.txt` → `python-3.11.9`

### Updated packages:
- ✅ `pandas==2.1.3` → `pandas==2.2.3` (Python 3.13 compatible)
- ✅ `numpy==1.26.2` → `numpy==1.26.4`

---

## 🚀 Deploy the Fix (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```powershell
git add deployment/
git commit -m "Fix: Add runtime.txt for Python 3.11.9 compatibility"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Render

Go to your Render service and:
1. Click **"Manual Deploy"** dropdown
2. Select **"Clear build cache & deploy"**
3. Wait for build to complete (~5-10 minutes)

### Step 3: Verify

Check that build logs show:
```
Using Python version: 3.11.9  ✅ (not 3.13.4)
Successfully installed pandas-2.2.3  ✅
Build succeeded  ✅
```

## 📝 What Changed

| Before | After | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Python 3.13.4 (Render default) | Python 3.11.9 (via runtime.txt) | Pandas compatibility |
| pandas==2.1.3 | pandas==2.2.3 | Python 3.11-3.13 support |
| No runtime.txt | runtime.txt added | Control Python version |

## 🎯 This Fixes All 3 APIs

Apply this same fix to ALL THREE services:
- ✅ Job Recommendation API
- ✅ Skill Gap API  
- ✅ Chatbot API

Each now has `runtime.txt` specifying Python 3.11.9.

## 💡 Why This Happened

Render recently updated their default Python to 3.13.4, but pandas 2.1.3 doesn't compile on Python 3.13 due to internal API changes. The `runtime.txt` file forces Render to use Python 3.11.9 instead.
