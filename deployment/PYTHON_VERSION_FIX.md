# 🐍 Python Version Compatibility Fix

## Problem

You encountered this error on Render:
```
error: too few arguments to function '_PyLong_AsByteArray'
```

**Root Cause:** Pandas 2.1.3 is **not compatible** with Python 3.13+. The API changed in Python 3.13.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've made TWO changes to fix this:

### 1. Added `runtime.txt` files (Method 1 - Recommended)

Created `runtime.txt` in each API folder:
```
python-3.11.9
```

This tells Render to use Python 3.11.9 instead of the default Python 3.13.

**Files created:**
- `deployment/job-recommendation-api/runtime.txt`
- `deployment/skill-gap-api/runtime.txt`
- `deployment/chatbot-api/runtime.txt`

### 2. Updated pandas version (Method 2 - Backup)

Also updated `requirements.txt` to use pandas 2.2.3 which supports Python 3.11-3.13:
```
pandas==2.2.3  (was 2.1.3)
numpy==1.26.4  (was 1.26.2)
```

## 🚀 How to Fix Your Render Deployment

### Option A: Use runtime.txt (Recommended)

1. **Push the new files to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add deployment/*/runtime.txt
   git add deployment/*/requirements.txt
   git commit -m "Fix Python version compatibility for Render"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **On Render Dashboard:**
   - Go to your service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"
   - This will use Python 3.11.9 (specified in runtime.txt)

### Option B: Manually set Python version on Render

If runtime.txt doesn't work:

1. Go to Render Dashboard → Your Service → Settings
2. Look for **"Python Version"** or **"Build Settings"**
3. Set Python version to: `3.11.9` or `3.11`
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Trigger a new deployment

## 📋 Verification Checklist

After redeploying:

- [ ] Build completes without pandas compilation errors
- [ ] Service starts successfully
- [ ] `/health` endpoint returns 200
- [ ] Check logs for "Application startup complete"

## 🔍 Why This Happened

| Component | Version | Issue |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Render Default Python | 3.13.4 | Too new |
| Pandas 2.1.3 | Needs Python ≤3.12 | Incompatible |
| Solution | Python 3.11.9 | ✅ Compatible |

**Python 3.13 changes:**
- Changed internal `_PyLong_AsByteArray()` function signature
- Pandas 2.1.x compiled extensions break
- Pandas 2.2+ supports Python 3.13

---

## 🎯 Best Practice

For production deployments:
1. ✅ Always specify Python version with `runtime.txt`
2. ✅ Use pandas 2.2+ for Python 3.11+ compatibility
3. ✅ Test locally with same Python version as production

---

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If you still see errors:

1. **Clear Render cache:**
   - Settings → "Clear build cache & deploy"

2. **Check Python version in logs:**
   - Look for `Python 3.11.9` in build logs
   - Should NOT say `Python 3.13.4`

3. **Verify runtime.txt is in correct location:**
   ```
   deployment/
   ├── job-recommendation-api/
   │   ├── main.py
   │   ├── requirements.txt
   │   └── runtime.txt  ← HERE
   ```

4. **Try pandas 2.2.3:**
   - Already updated in requirements.txt
   - Supports Python 3.11-3.13

---

## 🎉 Expected Result

After fix:
```
==> Building...
Using Python version: 3.11.9
Collecting pandas==2.2.3
  Using cached pandas-2.2.3-cp311-cp311-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.whl
✅ Build succeeded
✅ Service started
```

**Fixed:** October 30, 2025
**Recommended Python:** 3.11.9
**Compatible Pandas:** 2.2.3+
