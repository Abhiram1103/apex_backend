## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start Simple
Don't read everything at once!
- ✅ Read `PROJECT_COMPLETE.md` (5 min)
- ✅ Read `QUICKSTART.md` (5 min)
- ✅ Run it locally (5 min)
- ⏸️ Read other docs as needed

### Tip 2: Use Interactive Docs
Once running, visit:
```
http://localhost:8000/docs

```
This catches issues early!

### Tip 4: Check Logs
If something breaks, check:
```
Render Dashboard → Your Service → Logs
```

### Tip 5: Keep Docs Handy
Bookmark these for quick reference:
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Commands
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Troubleshooting
- `/docs` endpoint - API reference
